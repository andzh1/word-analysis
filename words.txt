 That I feared it too Aragorn answered but less than other things I knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls heavily so far south save high up in the mountains But we are not high yet we are still far down where the paths are usually open all the winter 

 I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy said Boromir They say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor He has strange powers and many allies 

 His arm has grown long indeed said Gimli if he can draw snow down from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away 

 His arm has grown long said Gandalf


While they were halted the wind died down and the snow slackened until it almost ceased They tramped on again But they had not gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard Soon even Boromir found it hard to keep going The hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind the taller folk but it was plain that they could not go much further if the snow continued Frodo s feet felt like lead Pippin was dragging behind Even Gimli as stout as any dwarf could be was grumbling as he trudged

The Company halted suddenly as if they had come to an agreement without any words being spoken They heard eerie noises in the darkness round them It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but the sounds were those of shrill cries and wild howls of laughter Stones began to fall from the mountain-side whistling over their heads or crashing on the path beside them Every now and again they heard a dull rumble as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above

 We cannot go further tonight said Boromir Let those call it the wind who will there are fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed at us 

 I do call it the wind said Aragorn But that does not make what you say untrue There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs and yet are not in league with Sauron but have purposes of their own Some have been in this world longer than he 

 Caradhras was called the Cruel and had an ill name said Gimli long years ago when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands 

 It matters little who is the enemy if we cannot beat off his attack said Gandalf

 But what can we do cried Pippin miserably He was leaning on Merry and Frodo and he was shivering

 Either stop where we are or go back said Gandalf It is no good going on Only a little higher if I remember rightly this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope We should have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything else 

 And it is no good going back while the storm holds said Aragorn We have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff-wall we are under now 

 Shelter muttered Sam If this is shelter then one wall and no roof make a house 


The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could It faced southwards and near the bottom it leaned out a little so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones But eddying blasts swirled round them from every side and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds

They huddled together with their backs to the wall Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits and screened them a little but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried

A great sleepiness came over Frodo he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream He thought a fire was heating his toes and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo s voice speaking I don t think much of your diary he said Snowstorms on January the twelfth there was no need to come back to report that

But I wanted rest and sleep Bilbo Frodo answered with an effort when he felt himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness Boromir had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow

 This will be the death of the halflings Gandalf said Boromir It is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads We must do something to save ourselves 

 Give them this said Gandalf searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask Just a mouthful each for all of us It is very precious It is miruvor the cordial of Imladris Elrond gave it to me at our parting Pass it round 

As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour But the snow did not relent It whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew louder

 What do you say to fire asked Boromir suddenly The choice seems near now between fire and death Gandalf Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us but that will not help us 

 You may make a fire if you can answered Gandalf If there are any watchers that can endure this storm then they can see us fire or no 

But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment and then with a word of command naur an edraith ammen he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out and the wood flared and sputtered

 If there are any to see then I at least am revealed to them he said I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin 

But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes Their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire The wood burned merrily and though all round it the snow hissed and pools of slush crept under their feet they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze There they stood stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames A red light was on their tired and anxious faces behind them the night was like a black wall

But the wood was burning fast and the snow still fell


The fire burned low and the last faggot was thrown on

 The night is getting old said Aragorn The dawn is not far off 

 If any dawn can pierce these clouds said Gimli

Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness The snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter 

Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire but for a long time he could see no sign of their slackening Then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him again he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer Very slowly a dim light began to grow At last the snow stopped altogether

As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world Below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost but the heights above were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow

Gimli looked up and shook his head Caradhras has not forgiven us he said He has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on The sooner we go back and down the better 

To this all agreed but their retreat was now difficult It might well prove impossible Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet deep higher than the heads of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff

 If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame he might melt a path for you said Legolas The storm had troubled him little and he alone of the Company remained still light of heart

 If Elves could fly over mountains they might fetch the Sun to save us answered Gandalf But I must have something to work on I cannot burn snow 

 Well said Boromir when heads are at a loss bodies must serve as we say in my country The strongest of us must seek a way See Though all is now snow-clad our path as we came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder It was there that the snow first began to burden us If we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond It is no more than a furlong off I guess 

 Then let us force a path thither you and I said Aragorn

Aragorn was the tallest of the Company but Boromir little less in height was broader and heavier in build He led the way and Aragorn followed him Slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily In places the snow was breast-high and often Boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking

Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips and then he turned to the others The strongest must seek a way say you But I say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for swimming and for running light over grass and leaf or over snow an Elf 

With that he sprang forth nimbly and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time though he had long known it that the Elf had no boots but wore only light shoes as he always did and his feet made little imprint in the snow

 Farewell he said to Gandalf I go to find the Sun Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking the toiling men with a wave of his hand he passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn


The others waited huddled together watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness At length they too passed from sight The time dragged on The clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again

An hour maybe went by though it seemed far longer and then at last they saw Legolas coming back At the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope

 Well cried Legolas as he ran up I have not brought the Sun She is walking in the blue fields of the South and a little wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all But I have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet There is the greatest wind-drift of all just beyond the turn and there our Strong Men were almost buried They despaired until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit s toes 

 Ah it is as I said growled Gimli It was no ordinary storm It is the ill will of Caradhras He does not love Elves and Dwarves and that drift was laid to cut off our escape 

 But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you said Boromir who came up at that moment And doughty Men too if I may say it though lesser men with spades might have served you better Still we have thrust a lane through the drift and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves 

 But how are we to get down there even if you have cut through the drift said Pippin voicing the thought of all the hobbits

 Have hope said Boromir I am weary but I still have some strength left and Aragorn too We will bear the little folk The others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us Come Master Peregrin I will begin with you 

He lifted up the hobbit Cling to my back I shall need my arms he said and strode forward Aragorn with Merry came behind Pippin marvelled at his strength seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs Even now burdened as he was he was widening the track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went

They came at length to the great drift It was flung across the mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with knives reared up more than twice the height of Boromir but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising and falling like a bridge On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down and there they waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive

After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam Behind in the narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf leading Bill with Gimli perched among the baggage Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo They passed through the lane but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow The spray of it half blinded the Company as they crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them

 Enough enough cried Gimli We are departing as quickly as we may And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to return The threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break and the light grew broader

As Legolas had reported they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down so that even the hobbits could trudge along Soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before

The morning was now far advanced From the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands Far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the pass

Frodo s legs ached He was chilled to the bone and hungry and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill Black specks swam before his eyes He rubbed them but the black specks remained In the distance below him but still high above the lower foothills dark dots were circling in the air

 The birds again said Aragorn pointing down

 That cannot be helped now said Gandalf Whether they are good or evil or have nothing to do with us at all we must go down at once Not even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall 

A cold wind flowed down behind them as they turned their backs on the Redhorn Gate and stumbled wearily down the slope Caradhras had defeated them



Chapter 

A JOURNEY IN THE DARK

It was evening and the grey light was again waning fast when they halted for the night They were very weary The mountains were veiled in deepening dusk and the wind was cold Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of Rivendell When they had eaten some food he called a council

 We cannot of course go on again tonight he said The attack on the Redhorn Gate has tired us out and we must rest here for a while 

 And then where are we to go asked Frodo

 We still have our journey and our errand before us answered Gandalf We have no choice but to go on or to return to Rivendell 

Pippin s face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell Merry and Sam looked up hopefully But Aragorn and Boromir made no sign Frodo looked troubled

 I wish I was back there he said But how can I return without shame unless there is indeed no other way and we are already defeated 

 You are right Frodo said Gandalf to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come If we go back now then the Ring must remain there we shall not be able to set out again Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master s hand again 

 Then we must go on if there is a way said Frodo with a sigh Sam sank back into gloom

 There is a way that we may attempt said Gandalf I thought from the beginning when first I considered this journey that we should try it But it is not a pleasant way and I have not spoken of it to the Company before Aragorn was against it until the pass over the mountains had at least been tried 

 If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate then it must be evil indeed said Merry But you had better tell us about it and let us know the worst at once 

 The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria
